                <li>Germination from large, easily handled seeds is rapid, and blooms should appear within a few weeks of sowing.</li>

                <li>The densely double flower heads of the African marigolds tend to rot in wet weather.</li>
                <li>Do not water marigolds from overhead.</li>
