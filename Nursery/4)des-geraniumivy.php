        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Geranium (Pelargonium peltatum) is a colorful summer bloomer with ivy-like foliage and cascading blooms that
            make the plant perfectly suited for window boxes and hanging containers. Geranium works well in mixed
            baskets with other colorful annuals.</p>
        <p>Geranium includes at least 75 different types, including a range of flower and foliage colors and variegation
            and a variety of sizes. No matter what Geranium you choose, it s bound to have attractive foliage and
            eye-catching blooms.Geraniums bloom in a burst of deep reds, scarlet, pinks, white, purple or salmon with
            flowers lasting throughout the gardening season. Geraniums are used in beautiful flower beds or in
            containers, planter boxes, or hanging baskets on porches, patios or balconies.Geraniums are hardy in USDA
            zones 9-11.Zonal geraniums are not heavy feeders, but since they are usually grown in containers, a light
            feeding with your favorite fertilizer, every 2-4 weeks, will keep them vigorous.Stressing them slightly by
            watering only after the soil has dried out completely for a day or two seems to encouraging more profuse
            blooming. Just dont leave them dry for so long they start dropping leaves and declining.</p>

        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
        <ul>
            <li>Cut back your geraniums by about two-thirds if and when the weather drops below 45 F.</li>
            <li>Move the pots indoors to a sunny, south-facing window that gets at least four hours a day of direct sun.
            </li>
            <li>Stop fertilizing and limit water to once a week, keeping the plants on the dry side, while they are in
                the house.</li>
            <li>Begin to add fertilizer to the plant water again when you see new growth in late winter or early spring.
            </li>
            <li>Pruning: If your plants are long stemmed or with leaves only at the tips, and the shape of your plant is
                off then they should be pruned.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Geranium Ivy care</h3>
        <p>ou can start zonal geraniums from seed, cuttings or transplants. Taking cuttings was the traditional method
            of propagating geraniums and maintaining favorite varieties. If you choose to take cuttings, make sure you
            only use healthy, vigorous plants.</p>
        <p>Geranium can easily be started from seed, although the seed is usually for F1 hybrids. Seed geraniums are
            bred to be disease resistant and to bloom well in the heat of summer.Start seeds 8 - 10 weeks before your
            last frost date. They can take up to 2 weeks to germinate and should be kept warm, 70 and 75F (21 to 24C),
            and moist in the process. Scarifying the seed before planting will help aid germination.</p>

                    <td>Many geraniums are killed because of improper watering. Establish a wet-saturated to moist-dry
                        watering cycle. The plant needs to be thoroughly watered so the soil is wet all the way to the
                        center of the root ball. Check the plant s need for watering by looking at the soil; better yet,
                        scratch the soil surface with your finger or use a moisture meter. If the soil is barely moist
                        or dry below the surface layer, the plant needs watering. Anything wetter than barely moist
                        should probably wait. I say probably because so much depends on the weather. If we are in the
                        midst of a heat wave, or if the plant will be exposed to dry winds, it may need watering more
                        often to maintain it through the day. Container plants should be watered in the morning hours if
                        possible.</td>
