        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The rose is a perennial flowering plant.The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose to yellow roses and sometimes white or purple roses, peach, orange.</p>
        <p>The fragrance of Rose flowers depends on its variety and climatic conditions, hence this plant may or may not produce fragrant flowers.The flowers are densely filled with petals, much like antique roses. English roses are a good choice for cutting gardens.</p>
        <p>Some varieties climb if left unpruned and can be trained along a fence or arbour.The symbolism of rose colours is steeped in tradition. Roses inspired people over thousands of years to develop a language of colour.</p>

        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <ul>
                <li>Roses, especially the repeat flowering varieties, need a generous supply of nutrients regularly through the growing season.</li>
                <li>Slow release or organic fertilizers applied to the ground are the most effective; however foliar feeds are also valuable for a quick effect and to help keep the leaves healthy.</li>
                <li>Mulching with organic matter (a very wide range is available) is a very important part of rose growing, helping to conserve water, keeping the ground cool and feeding the micro organisms and worms in the soil.</li>
                <li>It should preferably be well rotted and, if it starts to disappear during the season, be reapplied.</li>
                <li>The best way to keep your plants free from pests and diseases is to choose disease resistant varieties and to grow them as well as possible.</li>
                <li>Early spring is the best time to prune. If it is still winter, your overeager cuts may lead to frost damage.</li>
                <li>Pruning is pretty straightforward: Remove all non-negotiable growth, thin the plants, and then shape them.</li>
                <li>Experts advise cutting 1/4 inch above a bud eye so the bud eye does not dry out.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <p>When you bring rose plant and cannot plant it immediately, leave the plant in the box and lightly sprinkle the roots every day. Do not let the roots to dry out. Plant the rose plant as soon as possible. If cannot plant it immediately to the desired location, plant it in a container.Dig a planting hole according to the roots, the rose plant has.</p>
            <p>If it is 2 yrs, then dig a planting hole at least 6 inches deeper, so the roots of the plant can be accommodated without crowding or bending. Mix some fertilizer (cow manure or organic compost) with the soil in the planting hole, plant the rose plant carefully, spread its root and fill with soil. Firm the soil tightly around the plant.
                If the rose plant is not so old and has fewer roots then dig a lesser deeper planting hole.</p>
            <p>Cut a stem from a rose plant. Mix fertilizer with some soil, add little water to this mixture and make a firmly tight lump at one end of the stem.</p>
            <p>Dig a planting hole (index finger deep) place the stem with lump side down, fill with soil. Firm the soil tightly. Keep the soil moist continuously for 2-3 weeks.</p>
