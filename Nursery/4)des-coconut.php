    <div class="container care">
        <h3>Planting and care</h3>
        <p>To start to grow a coconut plant, begin with a fresh coconut that still has the husk on it. When you shake it, it still should sound like it has water in it. Soak it in water for two to three days. After the coconut has soaked, place it in a container filled with well-draining potting soil.</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">
            <ul>
                <li>First, water the coconut tree frequently. As long as the soil drains well, you really cant water it too often.</li>
                <li>If you decide to repot your coconut tree, remember to add sand or vermiculite to the new soil to keep the water draining well.</li>
                <li>Second, growing coconut palms are heavy feeders that require regular, complete fertilizer.</li>
                <li>Look for a fertilizer that provides both the basic nutrients plus trace nutrients like boron, manganese and magnesium.</li>
                <li>Third, coconut palms are very cold sensitive.</li>
                <li>If you live in an area that gets cold, your coconut plant will need to come inside for the winter.</li>
                <li>Provide supplemental light and keep it away from drafts.</li>
                <li>In the summer, grow it outdoors and make sure you place it in a very sunny and warm spot.</li>
